# NC-News: Front-end

## Description

This project was done as part of the Northcoders remote bootcamp (front-end section).
NC-news is reddit-like website where people can view articles on certain topics.
One has the capability of logging in as the authors of the articles. As a user, one is able to up-vote or down-vote other users' articles and leave comments, which can also be up/down-voted.

This website interacts with the [api](https://nc-news-shalom.herokuapp.com/api/) that was built in the back-end section of the Northcoders course.
